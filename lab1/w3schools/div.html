The <div> element is by default a block element, meaning that it takes all available width, and comes with line breaks before and after.

The <div> element is often used to group sections of a web page together.

Example
A <div> element with HTML elements:

<div>
  <h2>London</h2>
  <p>London is the capital city of England.</p>
  <p>London has over 9 million inhabitants.</p>
</div>

Multiple <div> elements
You can have many <div> containers on the same page.

Example
<div>
  <h2>London</h2>
  <p>London is the capital city of England.</p>
  <p>London has over 9 million inhabitants.</p>
</div>

<div>
  <h2>Oslo</h2>
  <p>Oslo is the capital city of Norway.</p>
  <p>Oslo has over 700,000 inhabitants.</p>
</div>

<div>
  <h2>Rome</h2>
  <p>Rome is the capital city of Italy.</p>
  <p>Rome has over 4 million inhabitants.</p>
</div>


Inline-block
If you change the <div> element's display property from block to inline-block, the <div> elements will no longer add a line break before and after, and will be displayed side by side instead of on top of each other.

Example
How to use display: inline-block to align div elements side by side:

<style>
div {
  width: 30%;
  display: inline-block;
}
</style>

Flex
The CSS Flexbox Layout Module was introduced to make it easier to design flexible responsive layout structure without using float or positioning.

To make the CSS flex method work, surround the <div> elements with another <div> element and give it the status as a flex container.

Example
How to use flex to align div elements side by side:

<style>
.mycontainer {
  display: flex;
}
.mycontainer > div {
  width:33%;
}
</style>

Grid
The CSS Grid Layout Module offers a grid-based layout system, with rows and columns, making it easier to design web pages without having to use floats and positioning.

Sounds almost the same as flex, but has the ability to define more than one row and position each row individually.

The CSS grid method requires that you surround the <div> elements with another <div> element and give the status as a grid container, and you must specify the width of each column.

Example
How to use grid to align <div> elements side by side:

<style>
.grid-container {
  display: grid;
  grid-template-columns: 33% 33% 33%;
}
</style>
